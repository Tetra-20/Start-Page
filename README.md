# Startpage
Start page I created from scratch. I use this for searching and accessing links quickly.

## Setup
I use npx http-server to run it on a localhost port.
You can add/remove/edit the links in the http file. If you wish to add/remove the boxes with the links in it, then make sure to copy and paste/remove the selector element and the linkbox element with the links inside.
